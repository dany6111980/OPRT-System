Use this at the end of each working day:

From today’s session, create a Context Capsule in Markdown.

Include exactly these sections:

Results — predictions, signals, calculations, outputs, code runs.

Instructions / Workflows — step-by-step routines, execution steps, or automation instructions defined today.

Reasoning Chain — why thresholds, formulas, or parameters were chosen; explanations of decisions.

Decisions Made — changes to architecture, thresholds, formulas, logic, or strategy. What was confirmed vs. discarded.

Open Issues — problems, bugs, or uncertainties raised.

Next Actions — tasks assigned for the next session/day.

Architecture & Code (if updated) — any code snippets, formulas, or file structures that were changed.

Format with a date at the top like this:
# Context Capsule — YYYY-MM-DD

Make it exhaustive and detailed so no insight is lost.
