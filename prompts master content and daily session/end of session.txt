From this chat, extract ALL information relevant for my OPRT Mirror Loop project.

Organize the output into a Context Capsule with these sections:

1. **Results**
   - Predictions/signals generated (bias, C_raw, C_eff, phase_angle, trap_T, size band, final decision).
   - Performance outcomes (if available).

2. **Instructions / Workflows**
   - Step-by-step routines, pipelines, automation or logging instructions defined in this session.

3. **Reasoning Chain**
   - Explanations of why certain thresholds, formulas, or parameters were chosen.
   - Rationale for architectural/logic changes.

4. **Decisions Made**
   - What was changed/added vs. what was discarded or kept.

5. **Open Issues**
   - Bugs, missing data, or uncertainties flagged.

6. **Next Actions**
   - Concrete tasks for the following session/day.

7. **Architecture & Code**
   - Code snippets, formulas, CLI/PS usage, file/folder structures, schema changes.

Formatting Rules:
- Use Markdown headings and numbering as above.
- Be exhaustive â€” capture all details (logs, formulas, thresholds, file paths).
- Insert [PLACEHOLDER] if information is missing, and note how to fill it.
